h1. SSL Requirement

Created by: Stefan Husch (free2b AT blun DOT org), 2009-10-30

This extension adds ssl requirement to your "radiant":http://github.com/radiant/radiant admin pages.

Tested with 0.8 and 0.9.1

h2. Installation

Starting from your radiant application root directory:

git clone git://github.com/jfqd/radiant-ssl_requirement-extension.git vendor/extensions/ssl_requirement

(The original ssl_requirement plugin from David Heinemeier Hansson is already included - you do not need to add it.)

No rake tasks needed.

The extension should be loaded as early as possible.

Add the ssl certificate to apache or whatever you use as a webserver. Restart webserver, restart application server - you are done.

h2. Compatibility

Compatability is defined in the config/ssl_requirement.yml file. There are a few default compatability settings. To add a new setting, simply add a new entry and specify if SSL is required or not following the same format as those already there.

h2. Features

If you use the "shared_layout":http://github.com/radiant/radiant-share-layouts-extension/ extension and want to use ssl with your own extensions put this into your extension.rb file under activate:

<pre><code># add ssl_required? method
if defined?(SslRequirementExtension)
  MyShinyController.class_eval {
    include SslRequirement
    def ssl_required?; local_request? || RAILS_ENV == 'test' ? false : true; end
  }
end
</code></pre>

h2. Acknowledgments

Thanks to all radiant core members and extensions authors!
