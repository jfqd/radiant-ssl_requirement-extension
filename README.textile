h1. SSL Requirement

Created by: Stefan Husch (free2b AT blun DOT org), 2009-10-30

This extension adds ssl requirement to your "radiant":http://github.com/radiant/radiant admin pages.

Tested with 0.8 and 0.9.1

h2. Installation

Starting from your radiant application root directory:

git clone git://github.com/jfqd/radiant-ssl_requirement-extension vendor/extensions/ssl_requirement

(The original ssl_requirement plugin from David Heinemeier Hansson is already included - you do not need to add it.)

No rake tasks needed.

Add the ssl certificate to apache or whatever you use as a webserver. Restart webserver, restart application server - you are done.

h2. Features

If you use the "shared_layout":http://github.com/radiant/radiant-share-layouts-extension/ extension and want to use ssl with your own extensions put this into your extension.rb file under activate:

<pre><code># add ssl_required? method
if defined?(SslRequirementExtension)
  MyShinyController.class_eval {
    include SslRequirement
    def ssl_required?; local_request? || RAILS_ENV == 'test' ? false : true; end
  }
end
</code></pre>

h2. Acknowledgments

Thanks to all radiant core members and extensions authors!
